## Wrote with Arianna Lamanna 
## R Blast 

## 1st step:

# Download the dataset on the hard drive (Need at least 4 TB), takes around 3 days to download everything:

wget -r -np -nH -A "*genomic*.gz" ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/bacteria/ 

# ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/bacteria/ this is to download the bacterial genome, can find also the genome for other organism  

# Data can be found on the hard drive Seagate (was downloaded at the end of March 2024) 

## Next step is to unzip the files (can be done on the terminal or in R) 

gunzip /Volumes/Expansion/Metaphlan4_Analysis/ref/refseq/release/bacteria/*

## Create the concatenated file 

cat /Volumes/Expansion/Metaphlan4_Analysis/ref/refseq/release/bacteria/*.fna > /Volumes/Shield4TB/Users/evangw/Desktop/bacteria_all.fasta

# File can be found ont the hard drive Toshiba (Evan_Personal)

## Download the Blast+ software from the following link 

https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/
 
# Note that all the download software need to be in the working directory of the R file 
# Software can be found on hard drive Seagate (was downloaded at the end of March 2024) 
 
## Prepare sequence for blasting 
 
# Sequence needs to be in a FASTA format if it is not a FASTA file then
# If you want to Blast an unknown sequence form MetaPhlan4 find the SG code in the microorganisms-2800384-supplementary.pdf (on Seagate) by pasting the GGB code (ex: GGB23855)
# Now you can connect to the HPC and go in the directory of the mpa_vOct22_CHOCOPhlAnSGB_202212_SGB.fna 

cd /scratch/users/alamanna/ENTER/envs/metaphlan/lib/python3.7/site-packages/metaphlan/metaphlan_databases/
 
# Now extract just the wanted sequences using grep 
â€‹
grep -i 'SGB_CODE' -A 20  mpa_vOct22_CHOCOPhlAnSGB_202212_SGB.fna > FILE_NAME.txt

# Copy file on the computer 

 ## 3rd step:
 
 # Run the RScript in RStudio  
 
 # file name: R_blast.Rmd
